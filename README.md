# Region Open Data Status

Visualization of regions open data publication status in Sweden

## Description

The Swedish govenment launched a [directive](https://www.regeringen.se/om-webbplatsen/psi-direktivet/) which requires the public sector to publish data openly to the public. [Nationella Dataverkstaden](https://www.vgregion.se/ov/dataverkstad/) at [Västra Götalands Region (VGR)](https://www.vgregion.se/) has been tasked with supporting municipalities and regions with publishing open data. We have created this visualization in order to make it easier to track the progress of each region and their municipalities. 

[MetaSolution](https://entryscape.com/en/) and [Insigo](https://insigo.se/en/) has been tasked by VGR to create a visualization of each regions progress in regards to publication of open data. MetaSolution has contributed with data modelling expertise and file hosting on the Entryscape platform. Insigo has written the code and assisted with technical advice.
